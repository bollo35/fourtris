# Kinda Tetris

This is a very simplified implementation of tetris. The purpose is not to be the most faithful reproduction of Tetris, rather to (re)familiarize myself with rust.

There will be bugs. Let me know what you find.

## Controls
Left Arrow - Move a piece to the left.
Right Arrow - Move a piece ot the right.
Down Arrow - Hold down to make a piece fall faster. (No hard drop implemented)
Q - Counterclockwise rotation.
W - Clockwise rotation.
